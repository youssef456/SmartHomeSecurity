# Atmega32  Drivers & Applications

Welcome to the Atmega32 Device Drivers repository, where you'll find a collection of device drivers, MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer), HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), application examples, and two real-time operating systems implementations for the Atmega32 microcontroller.

## Contents

### 1. Device Drivers
This directory contains low-level device drivers to interface with various peripherals of the Atmega32, ensuring hardware abstraction and easy integration into your projects. Each device driver has its own README for detailed usage instructions.

### 2. MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)
The MCAL folder holds the Microcontroller Abstraction Layer, which provides low-level control and access to the microcontroller's registers and peripherals. Refer to the individual READMEs for usage guidelines.

### 3. HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
Discover the HAL directory, where you'll find higher-level abstractions for common hardware components like LCDs, stepper motors, and keypads. Each module is well-documented in its respective README.

### 4. Applications
Explore the Applications folder for practical examples showcasing the integration of various drivers and components. The README in each application folder explains its purpose and usage.

### 5. FreeRTOS Implementation
In the FreeRTOS directory, find an implementation of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system for multitasking and scheduling. The README in this directory explains how to get started with FreeRTOS on the Atmega32.

### 6. SimpleRTOS Implementation
The SimpleRTOS directory contains a lightweight implementation of a simple real-time operating system for basic task scheduling. Refer to the README for instructions on using SimpleRTOS.
